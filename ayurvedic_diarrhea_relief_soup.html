            <p>The ginger and spices in this recipe have traditionally been used in Ayurveda to promote digestive health, alleviate inflammation, and soothe the stomach. Ghee is also a common ingredient in Ayurvedic remedies and is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties. This recipe can be modified by adjusting the amounts of spices or adding other herbs, such as basil or mint, to suit individual preferences.</p>
