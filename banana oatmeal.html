            <p>This simple meal is easy to digest and may help soothe the stomach. Bananas are rich in potassium, which can help regulate the balance of fluids in the body and alleviate nausea. Oatmeal is also easy on the stomach and can provide a good source of fiber and nutrients. However, if your nausea persists or is severe, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
