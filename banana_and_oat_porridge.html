            <p>Bananas are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, and potassium, which can help support the immune system and regulate body temperature. Oats are also a good source of fiber, which can help regulate digestion and promote healthy bowel movements. This porridge is a comforting and nourishing option that may help alleviate fever symptoms. However, it's important to note that if the fever persists or worsens, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.</p>
