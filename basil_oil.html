            <p>Basil oil has natural anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that can help to soothe the pain and inflammation associated with earaches. It also has antibacterial properties that can help to fight off any infection that may be causing the earache. This remedy is safe and effective for both children and adults, but should not be used if you have a ruptured eardrum or any other ear condition without first consulting a doctor.</p>
