            <p>To use the calendula salve, apply a small amount to the affected area as needed. Calendula is known for its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties, so it can be helpful for a variety of skin irritations, such as rashes, insect bites, and minor cuts and scrapes.</p>

            <p class="steps">Step 1: In a double boiler, combine the dried calendula flowers and the carrier oil. If you don't have a double boiler, you can use a heat-safe bowl set over a pot of simmering water.</p>
            <p class="steps">Step 2: Heat the mixture over low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. You want to infuse the oil with the properties of the calendula flowers.</p>
            <p class="steps">Step 3: Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or fine-mesh strainer to remove the calendula flowers.</p>
            <p class="steps">Step 4: Return the infused oil to the double boiler and add the beeswax. Heat until the beeswax is melted and fully combined with the oil.</p>
            <p class="steps">Step 5: Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in the lavender essential oil (if using).</p>
            <p class="steps">Step 6: Pour the mixture into jars or tins and let it cool and solidify.</p>
