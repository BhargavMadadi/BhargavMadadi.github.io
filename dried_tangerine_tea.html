            <p>Dried tangerine peel (chenpi) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine for digestive problems, including stomach ache. It is believed to regulate the qi (energy flow) in the stomach, improve digestion, and alleviate stomach pain. Ginger is also commonly used in Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and is believed to help with stomach cramps and bloating. Drinking this mixture slowly can also help relax the stomach muscles and alleviate pain.</p>
