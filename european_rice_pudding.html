            <p>This rice pudding recipe can be a gentle and soothing food for someone experiencing diarrhea. The rice is easy to digest and the milk and sugar provide some nourishment and energy. The cinnamon is also thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, which can be beneficial for easing digestive discomfort. You can modify the recipe by adding more or less sugar, adjusting the consistency to your liking, or adding other flavorings, such as nutmeg or lemon zest.</p>
