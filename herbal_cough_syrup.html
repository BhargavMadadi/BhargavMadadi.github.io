            <p>Senna leaves are a natural laxative that can help to stimulate bowel movements and relieve constipation. Dandelion leaves can help to stimulate the liver and gallbladder, which can improve digestion and help to eliminate waste from the body. Fennel seeds have antispasmodic properties that can help to relax the muscles in the digestive tract, which can relieve cramping and promote regularity. This herbal tea can be a gentle and effective way to help relieve constipation naturally. </p>
