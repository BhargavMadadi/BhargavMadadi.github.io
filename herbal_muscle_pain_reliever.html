            <p>This might be just what you need to feel better from muscle pain. The epsom salt and peppermint oils help cool down your muscles and make you feel better. Note: It's important to always dilute essential oils in a carrier oil or a base such as Epsom salt before use. Do not apply undiluted essential oils directly to your skin. Additionally, if you have any medical conditions or concerns, consult with your healthcare provider before trying any new remedies.</p>
