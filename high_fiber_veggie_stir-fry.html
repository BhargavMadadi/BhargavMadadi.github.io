            <p>This high fiber veggie stir-fry is packed with fiber, which can help to promote regularity and prevent constipation. The vegetables provide both soluble and insoluble fiber, which can help to soften the stool and make it easier to pass. The quinoa or brown rice also provides additional fiber, as well as complex carbohydrates to keep you feeling full and satisfied. Additionally, the garlic and onion can help to stimulate the digestive system and promote healthy gut bacteria.</p>
