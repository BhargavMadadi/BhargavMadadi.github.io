            <p>Khichdi is a traditional Indian comfort food that's easy to make and easy to digest. It's a one-pot meal that's perfect for when you're feeling under the weather, as it's gentle on the stomach and packed with nutrients from the rice and dal. You can adjust the spice level to your liking by adding more or less green chilies and red chili powder. You can also add some chopped vegetables, such as carrots, peas, or cauliflower, to the khichdi for extra nutrition.
