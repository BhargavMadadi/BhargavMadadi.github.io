            <p>Some people may prefer their okayu to be more soupy or thicker, so feel free to adjust the water ratio to your liking. You can also experiment with different toppings, such as soy sauce, sesame seeds, or cooked vegetables. Okayu can be a gentle and nourishing food for those with upset stomachs, and the ginger is thought to have anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits.
