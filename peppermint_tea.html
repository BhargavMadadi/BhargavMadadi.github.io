            <p>Peppermint is a natural antispasmodic that can help to relax the muscles of the digestive tract, relieving cramps and spasms that can cause nausea. It also has a soothing effect on the stomach and may help to reduce inflammation. If you do not have dried peppermint leaves, you can use fresh peppermint leaves or peppermint oil. However, be careful with the amount of peppermint oil you use, as it can be quite potent. If your nausea persists or is severe, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
