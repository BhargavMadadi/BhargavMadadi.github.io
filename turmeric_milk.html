            <p>Turmeric has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and is commonly used in Indian cuisine and traditional medicine. The warm milk can also help soothe a sore throat and provide some relief from discomfort. Honey can also help soothe a sore throat and add a touch of sweetness to the drink. Note: If you are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy, you can use almond milk or another non-dairy alternative instead. Also, if your symptoms persist or worsen, it's best to consult a doctor.</p>
