            <p>Warm lemon water can help to stimulate bowel movements and relieve constipation. Lemon juice is a natural diuretic and can help to flush out toxins and waste from the body. It also contains citric acid, which can help to stimulate the digestive system and promote the production of digestive juices. Additionally, warm water helps to soften the stool and make it easier to pass. If your constipation is severe or if it persists for more than a few days, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
